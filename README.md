# SquareUp

## Northcoders Final Group Project

### Welcome to SquareUp, our final group project at Northcoders!

We were tasked with creating an online application using at least two new technologies, all while adopting an agile working environment and using best industry practices. We created SquareUp - a mobile app that allows board game enthusiasts to connect with each other, join and host events, instant message other users, discover new games and find events near them on a map.

## Tech Stack Used

- JavaScript
- React Native
- Firebase Authentication
- Firestore
- Expo
- Node
- Google Maps

## Installation

To run locally, follow these instructions:

1. Ensure you have node.js installed (you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en))

2. Install Expo CLI globally on your machine by running the following command: `npm install -g expo-cli`

3. Fork and clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/magnificent-angels/square-up`

4. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

5. Run `npm start` to start the Expo Development Server. From there, you can run the app on an iOS Simulator or scan the QR code to run it on your Android or iOS device.
